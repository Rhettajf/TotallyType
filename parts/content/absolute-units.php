<p>In print, type is typically measured in absolute or fixed units — picas and points. The PostScript point is <span class="frac">1/72</span> inch. The  PostScript pica is a subdivision of 12 points. Generally picas are used for measuring the page — columns widths, margins, graphics etc. When we talk about type size in print, we are referring to its point size.</p>

<p>The fine tuned elements of typography — indents, line spacing, font size, etc. — are generally measured in points. When each letter was cast on its own block, the block had to be taller and wider than the letter impression to prevent letters from touching. In metal type each point size had to be cut individually; point size was defined by the height of the block — not the impression. The block was slightly taller than the tallest ascender and the longest descender. When type went digital, the block was represented by the <i>bounding box</i>. Digital type was not limited to a particular size, rather it could be scaled to any point size so it did not adhere to the strict ascender to descender rule. We will get back to digital type a little later in this lesson. </p>
