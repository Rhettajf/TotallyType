<h2>x-height</h2>
<p>x-height is the distance between the baseline and mid-line; it is the same height as the lowercase letter ‘x’. An increased x-height has one of the most noticeable effects on legibility and readability on screen and in print. However, the reason we want a taller x-height is not so obvious. The short answer is that a taller x-height helps forms appear bigger at text sizes and therefore increases readability.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="large-3 column">
  <img src="img/x-height2.png" width="351" height="189" alt=""/> 
</div>
<div class="large-3 column">
  <img src="img/x-height1.png" width="351" height="189" alt=""/> 
</div>
</div>
<p>Lowercase letters are enclosed within the x-height. In the example above, the letters <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>s</i> were chosen because they each have three horizontal strokes occurring within the x-height; that is a busy space sure to cause problems. On screen when pixels are in close proximity they blur together decreasing character distinguishability. A taller x-height like Frutiger’s, forces the counters and apertures in those tight spaces open, and therefore we get more legible rasterized letters on screen.</p>
