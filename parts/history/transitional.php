        <p>The transitional period is so named for its chronological position of development, which falls between the Venetian and Didone categories. Transitional typefaces were influenced by rationalist philosophy and Neoclassicism; these movements visually manifest themselves in the types that have a near vertical axis, high stroke contrast, and sharper serifs.</p>
