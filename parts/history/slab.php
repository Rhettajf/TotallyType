        <p>Prior to the Industrial Revolution, typeface design was almost exclusively oriented toward the production of books. With new technology, printers and advertisers demanded bigger and bolder typefaces for advertising and display. Designers responsed by developing two forms of Slab Serifs: the earlier unbracketed versions known as Egyptians and the later, bracketed versions known as Clarendons.</p>

        <p>William Caslon IV created the first typeface without any serifs at all. It was widely rebuked at the time. This was the start of what we now consider Sans Serif typefaces. During this time, type exploded, and many, many variations were being created to accommodate advertising.</p>
