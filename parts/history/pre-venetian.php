        <p>Pre-Venetian, also called Ancient, typefaces are inspired by historical forms from before the 15th century. Many include the Incised (Antique) and Fraktur (Blackletter) styles. Pre-Venetian typefaces were modeled after letters carved in stone. Blackletter is a style of calligraphy using vertical, curved and angled strokes. Popular from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance.</p>
