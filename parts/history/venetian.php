    <p>Movable type spread across Europe, and in less than fifty years, there were thousands of printers. As more people began to read, words became shapes and the demand for legibility and aesthetic appeal became greater. Movable type opened up opportunities for reproducing texts creating a demand for typefaces.</p> 
      <p>The hand-inspired Pre-Venetian lettering was difficult to read and time consuming to set; it did not reflect the demands and productivity of Gutenberg's printing press. In response, typesetters began looking for inspiration in various writing forms. Venetian, also called Humanist and Renaissance Antiqua, typefaces have the clearest relationship to pen-formed writing; the oblique axis is severe, the contrast is low and the letter components share the abrupt modeling of the broad-tip pen.</p>

        <p>Rather than using  blackletter or Fraktur type, printers began to create type that mimicked the hand of Italian humanist writers.</p>

        <h4>Nicolas Jenson 1470</h4>
        <p>Inspired by the text on ancient roman buildings, Nicolas Jenson combined a Gothic calligraphic style with Italian humanist handwriting, creating the first Roman Type. Jenson's type  was highly legible and evenly colored, it was much more readable than blackletter, and caught on quickly.</p>

        <img src="img/history/Manutius_oc.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>As print spread so did the demand for books. Early books were very large. To meet the need of scholars and students, Aldus Manutius wanted to produce books that could be transported. He invented the 'pocket edition' called an octavos that could be carried and read anywhere. Pocket books were the first version of the modern paperback and some even featured only text.</p>

        <p>To fit more words on a page, Aldus Manutius commissioned Griffo to cut a condensed typeface. Griffo based it upon chancery manuscript, a contemporary cursive roman face. It became known as Aldinian. Today, we call it italics and use it for <a href="family.php#emphasis" title="Emphasis" target="_blank">emphasis</a>.</p>
