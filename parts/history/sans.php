    <p>By the time slab serifs were in use, sans serifs had already been around for some time. To follow the progression of sans serifs, we must step back in time. The first sans-serif types emerged in the 18th century but did not became popular until the early 19th century. The first sans serifs are classified as grotesque as loosing the serif was a departure from hundreds of years of tradition.</p>
    
	<p>As always, simplicity requires the greatest effort. With fewer decorative distractions, sans-serif typefaces need to be flawless in proportion, color, and balance. The major difference besides the lack of serifs is contrast. Sans serif letters have low contrast, usually 75&ndash;90%. Many feel that sans serifs have less personality then serif types. This is far from the truth. Sans serifs are simpler but less tied to historical contexts, making them great for abstraction and creative exploration. There are four basic classifications of sans-serif typefaces: Grotesque, Neo-grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist.</p>

<p>The Neoclassical architect John Soane used sans-serif letters on his drawings and architectural designs, which were eventually adopted by other designers. Many claim this was the origin of the modern san-serif.</p>

     <h5>1786</h5>
    <p>In 1786 a rounded sans-serif font was developed by Valentin Haüy that first appeared in the book titled "Essai sur l'éducation des aveugles" (An Essay on the Education of the Blind). The purpose of this font was accessibility &mdash; designed to emboss paper allowing the blind to read with their fingers. The design was eventually known as Haüy type, the first attempt at brail.</p>

        <h5>1816</h5>
        <p>William Caslon IV created the first typeface without any serifs at all. It was widely rebuked at the time. This was the start of what we now consider Sans Serif typefaces. During this time, type exploded, and many, many variations were being created to accommodate advertising.</p>

    <h1 class="grotesque text-center example">Grotesque</h1>
    <h4 class="grotesque text-center hyphens">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</h4>
    <p>These are the first commercially popular sans serif typefaces. Contrast in stroke weight is most apparent in these styles, there is a slight “squared” quality to many of the curves, and many designs have the “bowl and loop” lowercase <i>g</i> common to Roman types. In some cases the <i>R</i> has a curled leg, and the <i>G</i> usually has a spur. This category also includes more modern, sans serif designs patterned after the first grotesques. Stroke contrast is less pronounced than earlier designs, and much of the “squareness” in curved strokes has been rounded. Normally the most obvious distinguishing characteristic of these faces is their single bowl <i>g</i> and more monotone weight stress.</p>

    <h1 class="neo-grotesque text-center example">Neo-grotesque</h1>
    <h4 class="neo-grotesque text-center hyphens">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</h4>
    <p>Neo-Grotesque, also called Transitional or Realist are based on the later Grotesques. These are more refined Grotesques with careful construction.
   Type designers were still feeling their way around the new style of the sans serif; thus, the Neo-Grotesques lose many of the awkward curves and idiosyncrasies that are common in Grotesques. Characterized by less variation in line weight and the single-story <i>g</i></p>

    <h1 class="text-sans text-center example">Humanist</h1>
    <h4 class="text-sans text-center hyphens">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</h4>
    <p>These are based on the proportions of Roman inscriptional letters. Frequently, contrast in stroke weight is readily apparent. Typographic experts claim that these are the most legible and most easily read of the sans serif typefaces. Humanistic sans serif typefaces also closely match the design characteristics and proportions of serif types, often with a strong calligraphic influence.</p>

    <h1 class="geometric text-center example">Geometric</h1>
    <h4 class="geometric text-center hyphens">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</h4>
<p>Simple geometric shapes influence the construction of these typefaces. Strokes have the appearance of being strict monolines and character shapes are made up of geometric forms. Geometric sans tend to be less readable than grotesques.</p>
